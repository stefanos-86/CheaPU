	Most of it is a copy-paste from another project I had already done. There is no other reason
	for the use of SDL or the structure of this code other than "this is already done and works well enough".
	
	The interface is "immediate" (redraw everything at every loop), because it is easy to do.
	The layout is entirely based on magic numbers scattered everywhere because I do not care much - I don't
	plan to maintain this code in the long run.

	Check also the cpp file's comments for more details about the specific parts.

		* A letter is an 8x8 matrix of pixel. Using one bit each, you can have a glyph defined by 8 bytes.
